# OpenClassrooms-P10-Reciplease

Welcome to Reciplease, where you can discover a variety of recipes to satisfy your hunger!

Our app offers a convenient way to create an ingredients list and search for recipes based on your selections. 
Once you provide your ingredients, you'll be presented with a list of recipes to choose from. 
Each recipe provides detailed information to help you decide which one suits your taste.
Reciplease also offers a "Favorites" feature, powered by CoreData, allowing you to save and access your preferred recipes with ease.
If you need more detailed instructions, you can visit the original website where the recipe originated from.

During the development of the 10th OpenClassrooms project, we gained experience in using CoreData, a reliable data persistence tool. 
This allowed us to effectively manage and store recipe data, ensuring a smooth user experience.

In addition, we successfully integrated CocoaPods, a popular dependency manager, to streamline the functionality and efficiency of our app.

Join us on a culinary journey with Reciplease and discover delicious recipes at your fingertips!
